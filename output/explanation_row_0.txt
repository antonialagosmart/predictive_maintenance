Row 0: The model predicts **NORMAL** with a probability of **0.05**.

The following features helped predict a normal condition:
1. **Motor_current** (value = 33.40) increased the model's prediction towards **risk of failure**.
2. **COMP** (value = 0.00) decreased the model's prediction towards **chance of normal operation**.
3. **MPG** (value = 3.60) increased the model's prediction towards **risk of failure**.
4. **LPS** (value = 19.10) decreased the model's prediction towards **chance of normal operation**.
5. **Oil_temperature** (value = 0.00) increased the model's prediction towards **risk of failure**.

The feature **Motor_current** had the most significant influence. Its value (33.40) strongly indicates a **normal**.
